	* Ability System Replication Mode: How gameplay effects will be replicated to clients
	*
	* - Full: Replicate full gameplay info to all. Every GameplayEffect is replicated to every client.
	* (Recommended for Single Player games)
	* - Mixed: Only replicate minimal gameplay effect info to simulated proxies but full info to owners and autonomous proxies.
	* GameplayEffects are only replicated to the owning client. Only GameplayTags and GameplayCues are replicated to everyone.
	* (Recommended for Multiplayer on Player controlled Actors)
	* - Minimal: Only replicate minimal gameplay effect info. Note: this does not work for Owned AbilitySystemComponents (Use Mixed instead).
	* GameplayEffects are never replicated to anyone. Only GameplayTags and GameplayCues are replicated to everyone.
	* (Recommended for Multiplayer on AI controlled Actors)
	*
